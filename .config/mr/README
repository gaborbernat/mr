vcsh - a tool that allows you to have multiple repositories in the same folder (aka your home folder)
====
a. vcsh [repo name] [command]
is essentially just an alias to the git [command] inside the repository

b.  you can also avoid specifying the repo name if you enter into that repo via vcsh enter [repo name]. 
    At this point using the vcsh or the repo is essentially the same.

c.
 to create a new repository you need to: 
 1. create a new vcsh repository: vcsh init [repo name]
 2. add new files                 vcsh [repo name] [commands] 
 3. commit to create first ref    vcsh [repo name] commit -m "start repo"
 4. add a remote server           vcsh [repo name] remote add origin git@github.com:gaborbernat/[repo name].git 
 5. create a remote branch        vcsh [repo name] push -u origin master 
 6. add it to mr 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mr - mr is the tool to avoid updating the multiple repositories one by one, essentially it's just a wrapper around the other repos. 
=== 
mr up - this command updates the repository, it does this by following convention
all configuration is stored in a vcsh repository itself, entitled mr

$HOME
    |-- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (defaults to $HOME/.config)
    |   |-- mr
    |   |   |-- available.d
    |   |   |   |-- zsh.vcsh
    |   |   |   `-- snippets.git
    |   |   `-- config.d
    |   |       |-- zsh.vcsh        -> ../available.d/zsh.vcsh
    |   |       `-- vim.vcsh        -> ../available.d/vim.vcsh
    |   `-- vcsh
    |       |-- config
    |       `-- repo.d
    |           |-- zsh.git  -----------+
    |           |-- tmux.git            |
    |           `-- vim.git             |
    |-- [...]                           |
    |-- .zshrc   <----------------------+
    |-- .gitignore.d
    |   `-- zsh
    |-- .mrconfig
    `-- .mrtrust

- the gitignore file should be in the root of git repo, for vcsh this is replaced with the usage of the .gitignore.d folder inside this the [repo name] file is used as gitignore
- the actual git repos are kept inside the vcsh folder inside .config
- the available git repositories are inside mr/available.d 
- the repos you would like to check on a local system are inside config.d via symbolic links
